There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Opal strives to make online learning more of a conversation between student and teacher by providing students a rare outlet in a video lecture environment. 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Opal is meant for teachers that want to share and collaborate on self-made or external educational videos with their students.

## Summary ##
  > Opal is a simple software that allows video viewers to comment on the videos they are watching based on timestamps. The main aim of this application is to provide educational feedback for online learning environments. Teachers can see where confusion arises, and improve online lesson plans. Optional exercises may be included to prompt students as they watch the video and keep them accountable throughout the learning process. 

## Problem ##
  > A good lecture video has the potential to be as good as a good live lecture. This, however, is rarely the case. Too often online learners slug through dull, confusing, unimagined videos.Without the  feedback that facilitates effective live learning environments, these dirths of education remain on the internet, and the most popular source for information has become plagued by boring, ineffective, or outdated learning material. Enter Opal. 

## Solution ##
  > Opal allows any teacher to equip a video with view-commentary feedback so that they can have a dialogue with their online students. Teachers equip a video with feedback ability. Students provide feedback. Teachers learn what educational points can be improved upon. Finally, the flow of communication is open again. 

## Quote from You ##
  > "With a world moving more and more towards online learning, the flow of communication has to be improved for the quality of our major learning source to improve."
