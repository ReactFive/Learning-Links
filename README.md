Opal strives to make online learning more of a conversation between student and teacher by providing students a rare outlet in a video lecture environment. Opal is meant for teachers that want to share and collaborate on self-made or external educational videos with their students.

Opal is a simple software that allows video viewers to comment on the videos they are watching based on timestamps. The main aim of this application is to provide educational feedback for online learning environments. Teachers can see where confusion arises, and improve online lesson plans. Optional exercises may be included to prompt students as they watch the video and keep them accountable throughout the learning process. 

A good lecture video has the potential to be as good as a good live lecture. This, however, is rarely the case. Too often online learners slug through dull, confusing, unimagined videos. Without the  feedback that facilitates effective live learning environments, these dirths of education remain on the internet, and the most popular source for information has become plagued by boring, ineffective, or outdated learning material. 

Enter Opal. Opal allows any teacher to equip a video with view-commentary feedback so that they can have a dialogue with their online students. Teachers equip a video with feedback ability. Students provide feedback. Teachers learn what educational points can be improved upon. Finally, the flow of communication is open again.
